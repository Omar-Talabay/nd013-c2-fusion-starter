Stable features have high refelection such as metalic as opposed to glassy materials.
## Therefor, partial structure, bumpers are tiers are strong features indicating the existance of vehicles.

## It can be validated from range images bellow that frontal/rear lights and partial vehicle structures (metal) are stable feature to identifiy vehicles.
